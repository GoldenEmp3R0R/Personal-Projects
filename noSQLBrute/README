This is the instructions to run nosql-brute.py

This is a simple python program that determines the users unique passsword for the login page at http:/www.example-url.com by iterating over a list of characters a-z,A-Z,0-9 for any number of positions.
There is a vulnerability on this page to NoSQL Injection, and this program leverages regex syntax encoding to bypass security mechanisms.

How to use:
1. Open up a Command Line Window/Terminal	
2. In order to execute program first do chmod +x on nosql_brute.py to confirm the file is executable.
3. Do python3 nosql_brute.py on the Command Line and wait for the program to finish. 

Your password will be printed on screen when the program completes



Expectations: Running this on Kali Linux machine.
